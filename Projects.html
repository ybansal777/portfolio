                            <br>There is a one minute timer for every round and the player with the highest score wins the game.</br>

                            With a partner, I was able to create a 2D game that involved many features such as time, levels, and score.
                            Both of us contributed equally to the project and were able to work together to develop an idea we had and debug our code as much as possible.
                            We worked together on this project in our Computer Science Principles class from August 30, 2018 to September 6, 2018. 
                            While we were working on our project, we kept a log of our work and documented every aspect of the process of developing it.

                            For my Python Image Manipulation Project, I worked with a partner to 
                            develop a program that takes certain images and based on the user's preference 
                            it creates a polaroid design around it and slaps on a logo in the corner. 
                            We developed our ideas together and collaborated equally in order to make the program which had almost no bugs and had a very smooth interface.
                            We worked on this project from March 4, 2019 to March 26, 2019 in out Computer Science Principles class.
