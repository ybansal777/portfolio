                        <p>Hi! My name is Yash and I am a Freshman at Dublin High School. 
                           I am interested in following a path in engineering and would like to show a few things about me. 
                           I am determined to do my best to make this happen by taking the most classes I can associated with 
                           computer science and engineering to prepare myself as much as possible for college. If I can do well then,
                           I can hope to land a good job in an Engineering career. This is my career choice because I am fascinated by
                           machines and computers and how they work. Getting paid to do something I love is something I prefer.
                            <br></br>
                           I believe I have many strengths which can be useful later on in this career path. One such strength is my passion 
                           to learn new things. I am an ambitious and curious person and I love to discover new information about computers and 
                           learn new programming languages. In the past, I have taken an Automation and Robotics Class in school, and a 
                           computer programming class after school. 
                            <br></br>
                           I have learned that things aren't always as easy as they seem. I learned that if you are ready to put in the work, 
                           these things will get easier and based on struggles I have gone through, I learned that I am capable of doing what I
                           set my mind to. I learned that if something interests me, I will practice it and get better it until I become the best at it.
                           When learning a new language, I was passionate and determined to speak it fluently and with lots of practice, I got better. When
                           I discovered the Rubik's Cube, I was so fascinated that I still practice it today and have no intention of stopping until I become
                           the best at it. 
                            <br></br>
